## SWIB 2019 Lightning talk
A very brief look at the idea of a WEMI for the broader concept of a "created work". In [PPTX](SWIBLightning.pptx) and [PDF](SWIBLightning.pdf).

## July 21, 2022 Talk to Core Bibliographic Conceptual Models Interest Group Summer Session
In this talk I emphasize the change in technology from FRBR (early 1990's) and today's use of RDF as a more flexible technology.
