## Bodleian Ballads
http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/

"The works represented there have an interesting alignment to FRBR because there are analogues to works, expressions, manifestations, and items, but they don't quite meet the exact definitions under FRBR (e.g a given ballad as a "Work" is not always distinct or even a deliberate artistic creation, because that's not necessarily how the folk process works - but it has many of the same qualities, and then there is also some fuzziness between the work and expression layer on top of that)" from Mike Bennett

This fits with our discussion about performances that can each be unique. Apparently, ballads are not fixed in nature and can have complex relationships to other ballads. The "workness" is not the same as it is for modern created works.

The Bodleian Ballads also can have related images - another possible set of interesting relationships between work-like objects. More about those at:
