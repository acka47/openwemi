# openwemi

The concepts first introduced in the FRBR document and known as “WEMI” (Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item) have been employed in situations quite different from the library bibliographic catalog. This is evidence that a definition of similar classes that are more general than those developed for library usage would benefit metadata developers broadly. This DCMI work product proposes a minimally constrained set of classes and relationships that could form the basis for a useful model of created works that defines WEMI as RDF classes with few constraints. These classes can be used together or separately in metadata to characterize aspects of creations. 

openWEMI classes are purposely defined very broadly. Experience shows that metadata models are likely to use openWEMI classes as superclasses to the more specific materials being described.
