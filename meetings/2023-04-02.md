## Minutes

### Examples
Sean has created an example using comics that includes getting down to individual collectables. Karen did a diagram of DC Terms as W-E-M using SKOS collections, not WEMI classes.

ACTION: Sean will clean up the [openwemi/examples](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/) directory

Other ideas for examples are in the [readme file](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/readme.md) in the examples directory.

### Relationships
We have agreed that the model needs to include the relationships between w-e-m-i. These are very basic but maintain the integrity of the model. 

ACTION: Karen to include the diagram that shows the relationships - perhaps in the readme.

The question is: what other relationships are needed? There is also a question of whether a top level class of ResponsibleEntity is useful (and works) for those particular relationships.

General sense of the group is that ResponsibleEntity is useful.

Heather asks: what connects RE and Endeavor?

Graeme: property could be `responsibleFor`

ACTION: Graeme to mock up a usage of RE entity and `responsibleFor` at a couple of levels to see how it works out

Another question is whether `responsibleFor` works for things like "owner". Sean mentions the idea of "relatedEntity" although that could be another Work. This needs more discussion.
