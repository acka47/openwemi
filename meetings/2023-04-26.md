### Defining Endeavor

Daniel: some ambiguity between work and endeavor
kc: mainly a structural function
Endeavor is not a superWork, but is a superclass to all of WEMI entities

AGREED: "A creation"

ACTION: kc will redo diagram including Endeavor

### relatedEndeavor

kc: we allow a work of work (etc.) but we don't go further than that
If we add these to all entities that fills out the general relationships
Without these, there would be a gap as people define entity/same-entity relationships

Ross: could commonX help us out here? 2 expressions of the same work would have a common work
It all gets more complex when you think about serials - because of the whole/part relationships. Part of a manifestation is still a manifestation? And parts could have their own Endeavor

Daniel: there is a work relationship in special issues because there is a creative element to the selection by the editor

kc: some descriptions will be more complex graphs than simply WEMI - Also, people can add other high-level entities, not just limited to WEMI

Ross: are the current relationships (.e.g expresses) also "relatedX"? 
(Aside: begs the question of defining a general "Related", but that might be going too far.)

ACTION: kc will start a diagram on draw.io, trying out a journal + journal article

ACTION: Ross will add "relatedX" to ttl file

### Noun or verb?

AGREED: verb

Ross: because predicate is a verb

Daniel: with noun you need to add something, like "is"

Sean: if you want the inverse you can have "expressedBy" "instantiatedBy"

kc: we can discuss inverse next week; having both properties means you have to know which one to search; a query can look at the reverse

Ross: higher order classes shouldn't have to have knowledge of the lower - a Work shouldn't have to know what Expressions express it. It doesn't make sense that an Expression would know its manifestations, but a manifestation is derived from an expression, so it has that knowledge.

kc: your graph does not have to be complete. You can create a manifestation without anything else, whether or not you add more information later. FRBR required completeness
