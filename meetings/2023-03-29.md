## Agenda

* Definitions ([issue #4](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/4))

Proposed:
* Work: "An abstract notion of an artistic or intellectual creation."
* Expression: "An expression in signs."
    * A perceivable method of bringing the work into existence - that might not involve signs; it could be a non-fixed performance or a thing that doesn't use signs, per se, like a sculpture
    * The method of expression
    * Expression is often used for versions - translations of texts; the same text but with added illustrations. So it's not just a method it's something that is "of the work"
    * A perceivable expression of the creation
    * A description of a perceivable form of the creation
    * A perceivable form of the creation
* Manifestation: "The physical embodiment of a creation"
* Item: "An exemplar of a creation."
    * A "single exemplar"?

Do we need more relationships?
    
Should we say that expression can be multiple?

(Note: I'm not happy with the definition for expression!)

Next up:

A discussion of the use cases for the superclass [Endeavor](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/1) and the [ResponsibleEntity](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/11), because they may be interrelated. 

## Minutes

* Noting that WEM are for conceptual entities; abstract
* Item is a description of something that is in the real world

### Definitions:
We feel comfortable with these definitions, but also agree that more of a description will be needed - perhaps in the vocabulary file but perhaps also as a document 
* Work: "An abstract notion of an artistic or intellectual creation."
* Expression: "A perceivable form of the creation"
* Manifestation: "The physical embodiment of a creation"
* Item: "An exemplar of a creation."

Note that these are not the things themselves (e.g. the Work) but are metadata descriptions of them. So all of them are descriptions.

Each of these will define a way to distinguish between ... two or more works, two or more expressions, etc. There may be actual tests that can be used to make the distinction within some domains. 

What the entities mean can differ in different communities, and it is possible that not all entities will be needed for all creations. Leaving this as open as possible allows communities to adapt these concepts to their use cases.

### Endeavor ([Issue #1](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/1))

Endeavor seems to be useful - for searching and for combining graphs from different communities. Sean noted that he could imagine actually describing some information at the level of Endeavor.

### CommonWork, etc.? ([Issue #10](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/10))

There are properties defined at https://vocab.org/open/ that allow you to say "these are the same ... WEMI". These could be useful. Karen will try to locate Ross Singer to see if we can bring these into the openWEMI work. The question is whether vocab.org is reliable over time. (Hmmm. Maybe create PURLs for these?)

## Next steps

* Meet again in one week. Karen will send out agenda.
* Agenda will include `ResponsibleEntity`
* Everyone will try to create examples - Sean will create one for comic books; Graeme and Karen will find something to model. List members: please
