## Results of the first two meetings
Thank you to all who joined together at the two meeting times last week. We resolved two of the open issues, [#2](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/2) and [#3](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/3)

* We will keep the names Work Expression Manifestation and Item - although these could lead some people to overlook the differences between the FRBR/LRM definitions and ours, keeping the names is a recognition of the origins of these concepts.

* We will (following the first resolution) continue to use "openWEMI" as the name of this effort.
