## Last week's notes

## Participants

* Karen, Sean, Ross, Phil

## Agenda

Question: can openWEMI properties take literals as objects? What does this change?

Main issue: [Allowing strings as objects to properties](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/46)

[Karen's lengthy examples](https://hackmd.io/wHblHyfdSweNRTqH7p7NOA)

Related to:

* [Inverse properties #40](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/40)
* [A cascade of constraints? #44](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/44)
* [Specific properties for each relationship #43](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/43)

## minutes

ross: What does expression of a string mean? 

phil: problem is that reality requires looseness. Schema.org lets it be easy for people to create data even though it's harder for people to use the data

ross: maybe this is an argument for a schema.org schema that uses this

phil: maybe give some advice on what the string can be. say: the string is the description of the thing

sean: then I like having another property that can take a string

sean: for people who need to map their data

kc: what if you only have a string - you can't create the data at all

phil: you can create a bnode with a string. It's a policy question

#40 option six: create a new property for string objects

ross: if you only have a text, a bnode is just a hurdle. A bnode has no identity. We define ranges, and define what it means if you do not follow it. A string infers that there is a bnode. 

sean: could also mint their own uris.

phil: low value of ok on use of strings; emphasize that strings don't give you much, so you should aim for at least a bnode, but preferably an actual IRI for the object

sean: documentation has to work a fine line

phil: and also for data consumers - if you find a string, it really means a bnode

Using a range with a class means that you can considered inverse properties (actual inverse properties, not just named inverses)

kc: question about owl:unionOf - test it out in protege, but we think it does what we want (an "or" between property ranges).

Decision: keep ranges in openWEMI

Next: discuss Sean's proposal to use `Endeavor` as the range in the place of (in addition to?) WEMI. See Sean's [comment](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/44#issuecomment-1577843702)
Also, [inverse properties issue](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/issues/40)

Karen will add this decision to the decisions document under Meetings
